# Popular Movies Project

## Project Overview

In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

## Stage 1

In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

You app will:
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:

-- original title
-- movie poster image thumbnail
-- a plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
-- user rating (called vote_average in the api)
-- release date

## What Will I Learn After Stage 1?

- You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

## Required Tasks
