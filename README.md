# Popular Movies Stage 2 Project 3

## Project Overview

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.

## Features
With the app, you can:

* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## How to Work with the Source
This app uses The Movie Database API to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to: app/res/value/api_key
